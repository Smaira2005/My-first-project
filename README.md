LOST AND FOUND MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
This Python-based Lost and Found Management System was developed as my first project during Semester 1. It provides an efficient way to report, search, and manage lost items while also incorporating an auction feature for unclaimed belongings. The primary goal of this system is to streamline the lost and found process, making it easy for users to register missing items, search for reported ones, and keep track of recoveries.

The system allows users to report lost items by entering key details such as item description and contact information. Once an item is reported, it is assigned a unique Report ID, which can later be used for searching and retrieval. Users can also view all reported lost items in a tabular format using the PrettyTable library, ensuring a structured and readable presentation of data.

In cases where items remain unclaimed for a long time, the system includes an auction mechanism to put these items up for bidding. If an item is successfully auctioned, it can be marked as sold, and the system will automatically update the records, removing the item from the lost and found database. Additionally, the program features data storage functionality, where all lost item records are saved in a text file for future reference, ensuring persistence across sessions.

This project provided hands-on experience in file handling, data structures, and user interaction in Python, making it a valuable learning exercise in foundational programming concepts. The project was built using Python and relied on the PrettyTable library for better visualization of tabular data. By working on this system, I gained insights into real-world problem-solving, coding logic, and data management techniques.

As my first coding project, this system reflects my journey into programming and sets the foundation for future development work. I look forward to refining and expanding it with additional features and improvements in the future. ðŸš€
